## functions

### definition

* a function $f: \mathbb {R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ associates to each number `x` in its domain **exactly one** number `f(x)`
    * other names
        1. `output value f(x)`: `function value`
        2. `input value x`: `value of the variable`
    * `domain`
        * all the possible input values

## graphs

### definition

* the graph of a function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the curve going through all the points `(x, f(x))` for `x` in the domain of `f`

## vertical line test

### theorem

* a curve in the plane is the graph of a function over a certain domain if every vertical line at `x-value`s in that domain intersects the curve **exactly once**
* in other words, **only one** point of the graph through every vertical line in the plane
